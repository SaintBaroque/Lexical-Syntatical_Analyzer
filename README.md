# Lexical-Syntatic_Analyzer
Basic Lexical Analyzer that can break down basic code into lexemes and tokens, and Syntatical Analyzer that can determine if the current input can be generated by the supported BNF grammar.

Created during the Spring 2024 Semester for my  COMP-360 class at North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. In this class we learned about the intricacies of program languages and broken them down to 
it's most primitive details. For project 1, we focused on breaking down simple code examples using lexical and syntax analysis.
